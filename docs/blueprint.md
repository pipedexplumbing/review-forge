## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to convey trust and sophistication, referencing Amazon's branding indirectly.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a very desaturated version of indigo to complement the primary color in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF) to highlight key actions and call-to-action elements.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to offer a balance of style and readability. 
- Emphasize a clean, single-column layout with generous spacing to improve readability and focus.
- Incorporate star icons for ratings and simple, intuitive icons for UI actions (e.g., submit, edit, copy).
- Introduce subtle animations (e.g., fading transitions, hover effects) to enhance engagement without distracting users.
